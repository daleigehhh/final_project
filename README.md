In the package rrbot, the robot model files in it are not rrbot in the gazebo tutorial but written by myself.

I divided the gazebo plugins (not complete yet) and the xacro files of the robot arm in two files.

After compile the work space, you can launch the launch files directly from the **launch** directory.
